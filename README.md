The following interactive features were added: 

    - A Theme Switcher that allows users to change the color schemes from dark to light. When the button is clicked on any page the theme will also change on the rest of the pages. 

    - A caption and animated button when hovering over the images on the Home page after the show summary. When the user hovers over an image a caption and button will appear. While inside the image and hovering over the button the arrows will animate and when clicked the user will be redirected to another page.

    - Integrated an API to display characters from Avatar the Last Airbender and the Legend of Korra. Within the page 
    it is possible to filter the characters by their nation.  
    API Endpoint: https://last-airbender-api.fly.dev/

    - Created a trivia game to answer questions about Avatar the Last Airbender pulled from an API. 
    API Endpoint: https://api.sampleapis.com/avatar/questions
