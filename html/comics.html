                        <h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender – The Promise: Part 1</h3>
                        <p>
                            Following the Hundred Year War's end, the Harmony Restoration Movement aims to remove Fire Nation colonies from the Earth Kingdom. Zuko, the new Fire Lord, makes Aang promise to kill him if he becomes like his father.
                            <br><br>
                            A year later, Zuko survives an assassination attempt by Kori Morishita, who opposes the movement. Discovering that Yu Dao, the first colony, has deeply integrated Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom citizens, Zuko withdraws support for the movement.
                            <br><br>
                            Zuko's decision sparks protests, prompting Aang, Katara, and Sokka to confront him. Avatar Roku urges Aang to keep his promise. Aang nearly enters the Avatar State but is calmed by Katara. Despite seeing Yu Dao's harmony, Aang insists the Fire Nation should not occupy Earth Kingdom land. Zuko argues for exceptions for all colonies. Aang agrees to mediate with Earth King Kuei. Unhappy Earth Kingdom protestors threaten action, and Zuko seeks advice from his imprisoned father, Ozai.

                        <p>
                            Aang and Katara travel to Ba Sing Se to meet Earth King Kuei and persuade him to meet with Zuko about the Harmony Restoration Movement (HRM). Upon arrival, Aang is delighted to find an Avatar Aang fan club, reminding him of his Air Nomad roots. However, their mission faces a setback when Kuei, determined to assert his strength post-Long Feng's manipulation, refuses to meet Zuko and instead orders troops to Yu Dao to enforce the HRM. Aang and Katara then return to Yu Dao to urge the colonists to evacuate before the Earth Kingdom army arrives.
                            <br><br>
                            Meanwhile, in the Fire Nation, Zuko consults his imprisoned father Ozai, who advises him that as Fire Lord, his decisions are inherently correct. Ozai predicts Kuei's aggressive response and encourages Zuko to protect his citizens. Zuko, fearing to mirror his father's ruthlessness, is hesitant. Concurrently, Sokka helps Toph with her metalbending academy in Yu Dao, which has been taken over by a rival firebending dojo. Toph's students, initially struggling, are inspired by Toph's belief in them and succeed in metalbending, winning their match. Zuko's girlfriend Mai learns of his secret meetings with Ozai and breaks up with him. Zuko, learning of Kuei's advancing army, reluctantly mobilizes his forces to defend Yu Dao, acknowledging his father's influence.

                            Returning to Yu Dao, Aang and Katara discover the city forming a resistance against Earth Kingdom protesters. Aang is offended by fans wearing airbending master tattoos and reaffirms his support for the Harmony Restoration Movement (HRM). Despite Katara's disagreement, they attempt to stop the protesters but fail. Meanwhile, Sokka, Toph, and Suki try to delay the advancing Fire Nation forces. Aang enters the Avatar State, ready to confront Zuko but is calmed by Katara, who highlights their shared future. Aang, meditating, rejects Roku's advice to kill Zuko, disturbed by their familial connection.
                            <br><br>
                            During the battle, Katara convinces Earth King Kuei to witness Yu Dao's reality. Aang creates a chasm to separate the armies, introducing Kuei to the Yu Dao Resistance and highlighting the city's unique integration. Kuei begins to understand, and Zuko collapses from exhaustion. Four days later, Aang severs his connection with Roku, deciding to prioritize his friends and the new world's complexities. Aang, Kuei, and Zuko agree on Yu Dao's unique status. Zuko apologizes to Aang, who reassures him to have faith in himself. Aang decides to teach the Avatar Aang Fan Club about Air Nomad culture, dubbing them the Air Acolytes. The trilogy ends with Zuko discussing the search for their mother with his sister Azula.

                            Two mysterious figures discuss one wanting to know everything the other knows. In the past, Ursa accepts a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Ikem in Hira'a but is forcibly engaged to Fire Prince Ozai. To protect Ikem, she lies about willingly accepting Ozai's proposal. During her wedding, Ozai forbids her from contacting her old family or acquaintances.
                            <br><br>
                            In the present, Zuko brings Azula to Ozai's cell to encourage communication. Azula, now insane, believes Ursa has conspired against her and escapes custody with information from Ozai. She burns Ursa's letters but offers Zuko information if he lets her join his search for Ursa. Zuko, Aang, Katara, and Sokka travel to Hira'a with Azula. Near the journey's end, Azula tries to flee but is restrained after hallucinating her mother. A giant wolf spirit attacks, and Azula lures it away with lightning. Zuko discovers a letter from Ursa claiming he is Ikem's son, which Ozai had intercepted.

                            In the past, Ozai hires Vachir, a Yuyan Archer, to kill Ikem. Vachir fails and informs Ozai that Ikem likely died in a dangerous forest. Confronting Ursa, Ozai accuses her of infidelity and reveals he had Ikem killed, but allows Zuko to live despite questioning his heritage. Later, Ursa learns that Fire Lord Azulon ordered Ozai to kill Zuko as punishment, prompting her to offer Ozai a poison to kill Azulon, securing his ascent to the throne, in exchange for her banishment and separation from her children.

                            In the present, Azula discovers a missing letter and attacks Zuko, suspecting Ursa's influence. After a fight, Zuko allows her to keep the letter. Zuko, Aang, Katara, and Sokka visit Hira'a, learning that both Ikem and Ursa ventured into Forgetful Valley. Despite Aang's advice to forget Ikem and destroy the letter, Zuko decides to go to the valley. There, they meet Northern Water Tribe siblings seeking The Mother of Faces spirit to heal a disfigurement. Aang finds the spirit, but Azula attacks the siblings, believing Ursa sent them to delay her.

                            In the past, Ursa returns to Hira'a and meets Noren, who reveals himself to be Ikem. Ikem explains that after Ursa's disappearance, he encountered the Mother of Faces in Forgetful Valley, who gave him a new face, allowing him to live anonymously in Hira'a. He offers to take Ursa to receive a new face as well. In the present, Azula battles the group until Aang convinces the Mother of Faces to come to their location. The spirit agrees to grant one request, and just as Zuko is about to let Misu ask for Rafa's help, Azula demands to know Ursa's location. The Mother of Faces reveals that Ursa is now Noriko, prompting Azula to leave to kill her, with Zuko and Sokka in pursuit.
                            <br><br>
                            The Mother of Faces, angered by perceived ingratitude, summons spirits to drive the group away. In the chaos, Rafa's face is revealed to have been stolen by Koh the Face Stealer. The Mother of Faces, repentant, restores Rafa's face and agrees to help repair Ursa's relationship with her children. Zuko and Sokka reach Noren and Noriko's home before Azula. Inside, Zuko reveals his and Ursa's identities. Ursa, now without memories, does not recognize Zuko. Ikem explains that the Mother of Faces erased Ursa's painful memories of her children. Azula attacks but is confronted by Zuko, who affirms his commitment to his destiny and acknowledges their complicated relationship. Azula flees, leaving an incriminating letter behind.
                            <br><br>
                            Aang and Katara arrive with the Mother of Faces, who restores Ursa's memories and original face. Ursa apologizes to Zuko, confirming that the letter was a lie and that he is indeed Ozai's son. She explains her reasons for writing the letter and Ozai's cruel treatment of Zuko. The story concludes with Zuko and Ursa discussing the past, symbolizing a new beginning for their relationship.

                        <p>
                            At a banquet celebrating Yu Dao's new coalition government, Aang has a vision of Avatar Yangchen and decides to celebrate Yangchen's Festival, bringing along Katara, Sokka, Toph, and the Air Acolytes. Tensions arise between Aang and Toph when Aang insists on following festival traditions without understanding their purpose, reminding Toph of her controlling father. The group discovers a town with a crystal refinery built over sacred Air Nomad land, upsetting Aang. The refinery, a joint venture between nations, impresses Toph but concerns Aang due to nearby river pollution and his visions of impending danger.
                            <br><br>
                            Aang and Toph argue over the refinery; Aang is upset about the sacred land's desecration, while Toph admires the refinery's innovations and prosperity. Toph dismisses Aang's warnings about his visions, leading Aang to accuse her of lying to protect her crush, Satoru. Their argument halts when earthquakes threaten the refinery workers, prompting Aang and Toph to cooperate to minimize harm. Afterward, Toph accuses Aang of clinging to the past, while Aang suggests Toph is running from it. The arrival of Satoru's uncle Loban and Toph's father Lao Beifong, who recognize each other, ends the novel on a cliffhanger.

                            Lao Beifong denies that Toph is his daughter and attempts to have her, Aang, and their friends removed from the refinery. After battling the Rough Rhinos, the refinery's security, the group splits up: Aang continues celebrating Yangchen's Festival, persuaded by the Air Acolytes, while Toph resolves to confront her father. Katara and Sokka explore a hidden cave revealed during the battle, discovering an underground iron mine causing earthquakes and pollution. During a ceremonial meal, Aang contacts the spirit of Yangchen, who recounts her past battle with General Old Iron to prevent him from destroying a city due to fears of human threats to spirits. An earthquake disrupts Aang's vision before Yangchen can explain the deal she made with Old Iron.
                            <br><br>
                            Meanwhile, Toph tries to prove her worth to her father by recounting her contributions to Aang's training, but he remains unresponsive, prompting her to sever ties with him. Katara and Sokka inform Lao about the unsafe iron mine, which Loban has been secretly operating. As they attempt to evacuate the workers, a Rough Rhino attack causes a cave-in, trapping almost everyone inside. Toph uses her earthbending and metalbending to save them from being crushed, but she cannot clear the vast amount of earth, and Aang is hindered by the iron ore mixed with the earth, making it impossible for him to assist.

                            The people trapped in the mine are saved by Aang, Toph, Penga, Ho Tun, and The Dark One. Before the rescue, Lao reconciles with Toph, apologizing for his past actions. During the rescue, it is revealed that the iron ore is General Old Iron's discarded armor. Loban attempts to escape with the iron to the Fire Nation as a storm develops. Aang tries to contact Yangchen but finds a crucial vase destroyed. He reconnects with Avatar Roku and learns from Yangchen that her deal with Old Iron required the land to be kept free from human civilization to prove humans could protect it. With the deal broken, Old Iron returns to wipe out humanity.
                            <br><br>
                            Aang prepares to destroy the refinery and town to reinstate the deal, but Toph and her students stop him, assuming he is clinging to the past. Their fight is interrupted by Old Iron's arrival, prompting Aang and Toph to team up. They strip Old Iron of his armor, and Aang delivers a fatal blow. Old Iron laments the diminishing place for spirits in the world before dissipating. Toph thanks Aang, and Loban reconciles with Satoru. Lao convinces the refinery workers to stay and rebuild. Aang, troubled by Old Iron's words, finds reassurance in Katara and a visit from Tienhai's reincarnation, who believes in human creativity and the potential for a civilization that can preserve and protect. Understanding the balance between preservation and evolution, Aang recreates Yangchen's Festival as the Spirit's Friendship Festival, celebrated joyfully by the townspeople and Team Avatar three months later.
